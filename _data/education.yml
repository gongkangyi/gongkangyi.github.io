    In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms 
    to perform image processing on digital images.[1] As a subcategory or field of 
    digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over 
    analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be 
    applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of 
    noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined 
    over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be 
    modeled in the form of multidimensional systems.
